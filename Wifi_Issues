We had a variety of issues with connecting our Wifi to the university network. Try the following:
1. Connect to Your Raspberry Pi: Sign in remotely to your Raspberry Pi, or as a Raspberry Pi Desktop, or Headless
2. Open Command Terminal and enter: sudo nano /etc/wpa supplicant/wap_supplicant.conf
3. Review wpa_supplicant.conf for Network information. Review networks that shouldn't be there. This is where you can input your username (identity) and password.
4. Additional items and how we typed it out:
  network={
        ssid="WIFI@OU"
        key_mgmt=WPA-EAP
        eap=PEAP
        identity="xxxxxx"
        password="xxxxxx"
        phase1="peaplabel=0"
        phase2="auth=MSCHAPV2"
5. When finished hit CTRL-X, then Y, then Enter to save the updated wpa_supplicant.conf file
6. Restart your Raspberry Pi
